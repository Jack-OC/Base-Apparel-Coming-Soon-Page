### What I learned

This was another good challenge to learn more about building webpages based on pre-made designs using HTML and CSS. To complete this challenge I hade to learn about using HTML forms to collect the users email address and then to use Javascript to verify that a correctly formatted email adress was submitted by the user. A form is an element that collects input data using various input types such as text, numbers, email, password and buttons. As this challenge is about a company asking users to sign up to their mailing list, the input type is an email. In JS I used a regular expression (Regex) to reify the inputted email. A Regex is an expresion used to find and or locate patterns in a string. This was initially dificult too understand but after testing out expressions I have a better understanding. I used a Regex to verify a correctly formatted email address which if was false would display a error message and icon to let the user know what they have inputted to the form is incorrect. Learning about forms and Regex was very useful and I will learn more about their uses in other challenges.
